      <p>I<span>t seems only yesterday that a team that is now known as MOWOG Inc had their first meeting. Prior to this
          two groups of people, Mini enthusiasts, then unknown to each other were talking amongst themselves at the
          Ohakea Air Base dual car sprint on what should be done to make a club happen.</span></p>
      <p><span>This enthusiasm lead to swapping of contact details and a few phone calls later, the two groups were
          linked, hence MOWOG was formed on the 20th April 1993. The club was formed by eight people, most of us
          strangers, all of us had a keen interest in the Mini motor car.</span></p>
      <p><span>We all pitched in $10.00 to start a float to make the club official, wrote a constitution, joined Motor
          Sport NZ and simply got on with it.</span></p>
      <p><strong><span>The key objectives </span></strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span> To promote good fellowship between Mini motorists and their associates.</span></li>
        <li><span> To instil pride of ownership and technical understanding of the marque.</span></li>
        <li><span> To preserve the Mini and its derivatives and to foster all its uses.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p><br /><span>MOWOG still enjoys its friendly, casual atmosphere to this day, 25 years from
          that</span><br /><span>chance meeting.</span><br /><br /><span>MOWOG Inc is an incorporated society and is
          Motor Sport New Zealand affiliated with a keen membership who enjoy all facets of Mini ownership from
          restoration, racing, customising or simply socialising.</span><span><br /></span></p>
      <p><span>Membership is open to any Mini enthusiast or its derivatives (Mokes, Riley Elf's, Worley's, BMW
          Minis).</span></p>

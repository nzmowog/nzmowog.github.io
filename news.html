      <p>This Easter 2017 60 Minis will muster in Kaitaia for the fifth running of the Pork Pie Charity Run. After 6
        days and 7 nights on the road only the best prepared , the fittest, the strongest, the desperate, cunning, and
        the most courageous, will arrive in Invercargill. Over 2,500 Kms of New Zealand’s peripatetic roads must be
        travelled. You will encounter some of New Zealand’s biggest pot holes, wettest valleys, climb through cold
        mountain passes, cruise long South Island straights, pass through our biggest cities and friendliest rural
        towns. And all this time you will be mesmerised by this country's unique and ever-changing scenery from the
        front seat of a Mini.</p>
